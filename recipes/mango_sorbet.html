    <h2>Description</h2>
    
         <p>Rich, luxurious sorbet perfect for those hot summer days</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large, ripe mangoes</li>
            <li>200g caster sugar</li>
            <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the mangoes with a vegetable peeler, cut as much of the flesh away from the stone as you can, put it in a food processor or blender.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar, lime juice and 200ml water. Blend for a few minutes, until the mango is very smooth and the sugar has dissolved - rub a little of the mixture between your fingers, if it still feels gritty, blend for a little longer. Pour into a container and put in the freezer for a few hours.</li>
            <li>Scrape the sorbet back into the blender (if it is very solid, leave at room temperature for 5-10 mins first). Whizz until you have a slushy mixture, then pour back into the tin and freeze for another hour or so.</li>
            <li>Repeat step 3. Freeze until solid (another hour or two). Will keep covered in the freezer for three months.</li>
        </ol>
